### 01-Calculator ###
I struggled a bit with this exercise. The main issue I had was when I wanted javascript to do 5+5=10, it actually did 5+5=55 instead.
I added the .value at the end of my variable, but it still did not work. I then did some research and discovered that I had to add a parseInt().
Eventually, my code looked like this:<br />
**const one = parseInt(document.getElementById("op-one").value);**
### 02-Calculator Two ###
This assignment made us work with switch. Not the Nintendo Switch unfortunately. Something that helped me out quite a lot were these 2 links: <br />

Here you can see the way to use the switch with buttons. <br />
I added the variables that would contain the input from the user **above** of the switch and not inside of it, because I did not want to repeat the variables constantly, and also because all buttons will use the same two fields for their input.
###### p.s., I have yet to figure out how to show the result of the calculator on the screen in a way that is neither document.write nor window.alert, I will keep you updated if I find something way more practical ######
